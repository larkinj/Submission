## Package Details
The Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is a nationwide census prepared by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
It provides the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

This package helps to use FARS data in your analysis. Filenames can be created programmatically using the make_filename function:
```{r}
farsFile <- file.path("..","data",make_filename(2013))
```

To load a FAR file use the far_read function:
```{r}
head(fars_read(farsFile))
```
